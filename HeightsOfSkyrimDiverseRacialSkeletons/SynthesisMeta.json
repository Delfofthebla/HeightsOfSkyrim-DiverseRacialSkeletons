  "OneLineDescription": "Compatability patcher between Heights of Skyrim, FK's Diverse Racial Skeletons, and anything that touches Races or NPCs directly.",
  "LongDescription": "This patcher forwards height changes from Heights_of_Skyrim.esp, as well as height changes from FK's Diverse Racial Skeletons.\r\n\r\nNote: you should load Heights_of_Skyrim.esp as high as possible to avoid conflicts. It must be placed above NPC overhauls. The same goes for FK's Diverse Racial Skeletons.esp.\r\nYou should still download other compatibility patches where they are available for either mod.\r\nThese two mods technically accomplish the same thing, but some may want the benefits of both without exaggerating their effects--that's where this patch comes in. This patcher can dynamically detect the intended variance from Heights of Skyrim and apply adjustments based on the racial changes that were made by FK's.\r\nYou can then apply a multiplier to reduce (or amplify) these changes to your taste.",
